* ~70g of cocoa powder
* 1 can of condensed milk
* 1 tbl spoon of butter
* Dash of salt.
* Chocolate sprinkles
* Vanilla extract
* Patience

---

1. Beforehand dissolve the cocoa powder into (hot) water so it doesn't get clumpy when you try to add it to the condensed milk (you might want to use a mixer). 

2. Melt  the butter in a non-sticking pot and add the condensed milk. Use low heat

3. Slowly add the dissolved cocoa powder into the pot while stirring. Also add a dash of salt.

4. Keep stirring in low heat, so it doesn't burn .It can take a while. Stir until you can see the bottom of the pan and the mixture has a doughy like consistency.  Once you scrape the bottom of the pot the mixture should take a bit of time to return.

  4.1.  Bonus - Turn off the stove and add a tea spoon of vanilla extract and stir for a wee bit more.

5. Put the mixture in a plate/bowl and leave in the fridge to cool.

6. Once cooled, coat your hands with some butter, scoop a tea spoon full of the mixture and roll into a ball with your hands. Then roll the ball around some chocolate sprinkles.

7. Eat
